# Aman Abraha — Information Security Analyst (Portfolio)

I build practical security projects that demonstrate security monitoring, alert triage, incident response, vulnerability management, and secure system hardening. My portfolio focuses on hands-on Security Operations Center (SOC) workflows with clear documentation and repeatable lab setups.

## What I’m working on
- Security monitoring + incident response with Wazuh (open source Extended Detection and Response and Security Information and Event Management)
- Active Directory (centralized identity and authentication) attack and defense hardening
- Vulnerability management (scan → prioritize → remediate → re-scan)
- Cloud Security Information and Event Management detections using Microsoft Sentinel (Azure)

## Featured Projects
- **Mini Security Operations Center Lab (Wazuh)**
  - Endpoint telemetry, alerting, and incident report write-up

- **Active Directory Attack & Defense Lab**
  - Domain build, identity attack simulations (lab-only), and defensive controls with evidence  
  Repo: https://github.com/amangmab/active-directory-attack-defense

- **Vulnerability Management Lab**
  - Baseline scans, risk-based prioritization, remediation, and validation via re-scans  
  Repo: https://github.com/amangmab/vulnerability-management-lab

- **Azure Microsoft Sentinel Detection Lab**
  - Log ingestion, Kusto Query Language detections, and incident investigation case study  
  Repo: https://github.com/amangmab/azure-sentinel-detection-lab
